# Notebook Directory

## Object Detection Models

This directory contains notebooks for training and evaluating three different object detection models: YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN, and SSD.

### Running Locally

If you wish to run these notebooks locally on your system, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- NVIDIA graphics card with CUDA support (if available, for faster training)
- Correct version of CUDA installed (refer to NVIDIA's documentation for compatibility)
- Python environment with the necessary dependencies installed

You can install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install -r yolov8s_requirements.txt
```

For Faster R-CNN:

```bash
pip install -r faster_rcnn_requirements.txt
```

For SSD:
```bash
pip install -r faster_rcnn_requirements.txt
```

#### Running the Notebooks

After installing the required dependencies, open the Jupyter notebooks in this directory and follow the steps to train and evaluate the models.

### Google Colab Notebooks

Alternatively, if you prefer to use Google Colab, you can access the pre-configured notebooks for each model. Google Colab provides a cloud-based environment with GPU support.
